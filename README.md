## Customizing and Localizing AnyConnect

AnyConnect can be tailored to fit specific needs by modifying installation settings, adjusting client preferences, and enabling localization.

### Installation Behavior Customization

* Adjust installation parameters via the `ACTransforms.xml` file for both Windows and macOS systems.
* Disable the Customer Experience Feedback feature if it’s not needed.

```xml
<ACTransforms>
    <DisableVPN>true</DisableVPN>
</ACTransforms>
```

### Localization Options

* Modify AnyConnect’s interface, alerts, and installer messages to display in your preferred language.
* Add a custom Help file if required.
* Use translation tables to adapt or localize interface strings and notifications.

## AnyConnect Profile Editor

Administrators rely on the Profile Editor to configure VPN profiles, define connection settings, and enforce security policies. Key configuration areas include:

* **Preferences**: Manage general options and auto-reconnect behavior.
* **Backup Servers**: Provide alternative VPN servers for failover scenarios.
* **Certificate Matching**: Set conditions for certificate usage.
* **Mobile Policy**: Define policies specific to mobile devices.
* **Server List**: Arrange the list of accessible VPN servers.

## Configuring VPN Access

AnyConnect supports a variety of VPN connection features. Key options include:

* **Start Before Logon (SBL)**: Initiates a VPN connection prior to Windows login.
* **Always-On VPN**: Keeps VPN sessions continuously active.
* **Trusted Network Detection (TND)**: Automatically connects or disconnects based on the network environment.
* **Captive Portal Detection**: Identifies restricted networks and processes authentication portals.

```bash
# Example: Enable Trusted Network Detection
vpn config trusted_network_detection enable
```

## Managing VPN Authentication

AnyConnect supports several authentication methods:

* **Certificate-based authentication**: Validates users via digital certificates.
* **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Adds an extra verification step during login.
* **SAML Authentication**: Works with identity providers for streamlined sign-ins.

### Enabling Certificate Authentication

To configure certificate-based authentication:

1. Generate and import the necessary certificates.
2. Define matching rules in the connection profile.
3. Configure VPN profiles to require certificate authentication.

## Network Access Manager

The Network Access Manager (NAM) manages network-level authentication and enforces access control rules.

* Supports authentication protocols such as **EAP, PEAP, TTLS, and TLS**.
* Applies security policies to both wired and wireless connections.
* Offers **Single Sign-On (SSO)** for improved user convenience.

> **Tip:** Set up fallback authentication methods within NAM profiles to ensure more reliable connections.

## Configuring Posture Compliance

Posture compliance ensures that client devices meet corporate security requirements before granting access.

* **HostScan**: Assesses endpoint compliance status.
* **ISE Posture Module**: Integrates with Cisco ISE for policy enforcement.
* **Advanced Endpoint Assessment**: Checks antivirus and firewall configurations.

```json
{
    "compliance": {
        "antivirus": "enabled",
        "firewall": "active"
    }
}
```

## Using Network Visibility Module (NVM)

The Network Visibility Module (NVM) provides in-depth visibility into network activity for enhanced threat detection.

* Gathers details about application usage, traffic patterns, and device interactions.
* Allows fine-grained traffic filtering for analysis.
* Integrates with SIEM platforms for advanced monitoring.

> **Note:** Verify that all necessary kernel driver modules are installed and configured to activate NVM features.

## Troubleshooting AnyConnect

If you encounter issues with AnyConnect, consider these steps:

* **Review logs** stored at `C:\ProgramData\Cisco\Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client\Logs`.
* **Run DART** (Cisco’s Diagnostic and Reporting Tool) to gather troubleshooting data.
* **Check connectivity** to the VPN server.
* **Reinstall the client** if issues persist after other troubleshooting.

## AnyConnect on Mobile Devices

AnyConnect is available for both iOS and Android platforms, offering features like:

* **Per-App VPN**: Limits VPN access to selected applications.
* **Always-On VPN**: Keeps the VPN connection active at all times.
* **Split Tunneling**: Routes selected traffic through VPN while sending the rest directly.

### Setting Up Mobile VPN on iOS

1. Install AnyConnect from the App Store.
2. Configure the VPN profiles and login preferences.
3. Enable **Per-App VPN** in the device’s VPN settings.
